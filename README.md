# How it Works

This app is a pokemon PC that allows you to take pokemon from an array of pokemon in the index (your PC) and put them on a 6 man team. 

The backend was created with 2 api's, one for the pokemon PC(index page) and the other for the pokemon teams. The backend connects to and pulls data from the 3rd party pokemon api to bring data and respond to frontend calls asking for pokemon info. 

The Carousel function was added to the pokemon teams to make a more dynamic feel when going through your team and making full CRUD alterations



# Roadblocks

For the most part, my roadblocks had to do with deployment. After creating the api it was a bit difficult to make sure everything was aligned correctly for smooth deployment.

It was also difficult for me to take the pokemon teams and give them CRUD functionality. Making the correct calls to my 3rd party api made it difficult for me to render much on the page for the pokemon teams. 

Carousel was a bit tricky to work with at first but I managed to get it working on the frontend.
